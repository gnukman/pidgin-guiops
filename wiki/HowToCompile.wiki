#How to compile.

=Linux=

If you compiled Pidgin from source, the following will suffice to compile this plugin:
  * Download the source code tarball
  * Extract the tarball
  * open a console window
  * type "make"
  * you should then get a file pidgin-guiops.so
  * copy pidgin-guiops.so to your ~/.purple/plugins directory


=Win32=

Still to be completed...
